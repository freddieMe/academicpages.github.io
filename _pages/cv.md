Postdoctoral research fellow at [CSIRO's Data61](https://www.csiro.au); PhD at the University of Melbourne, supervised by [A/Prof. Nicholas Geard](https://sites.google.com/site/nicgeard), [Prof. Karin Verspoor](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dUxHnbcAAAAJ), [Prof. Justin Zobel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uEHvqE8AAAAJ&hl=en), and [Dr. Benjamin Goudey](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=OiHpCBoAAAAJ&hl=en). My research centers on leveraging computational techniques such as machine learning and natural language processing to address real-world challenges across diverse scientific domains, including psychology, biology, and healthcare. My expertise involves aiding medical professionals by automating information extraction from electronic medical records, streamlining quality assessments for biological databases, incorporating bio-ontologies into machine learning frameworks, and employing large language models to comprehend emotion regulation in mental health resilience.
