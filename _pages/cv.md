Research fellow @ [CSIRO's Data61](https://www.csiro.au); PhD graduate from the University of Melbourne, supervised by [A/Prof. Nicholas Geard](https://sites.google.com/site/nicgeard), [Prof. Karin Verspoor](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dUxHnbcAAAAJ), [Prof. Justin Zobel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uEHvqE8AAAAJ&hl=en), and [Dr. Benjamin Goudey](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=OiHpCBoAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Research Interest: Applying natural language processing techniques to tackle real-world challenges in healthcare domain (Applied NLP for healthcare). I have implemented automatic solutions for extracting relations between biomedical entities within electronic medical records; streamlining quality assessments for biological databases; and incorporating bio-ontologies into machine learning frameworks. I am current working to help clinical psychologists to understand mental resilience (emotion regulation pattern) by applying text mining on large scale social media text.
