PhD(*thesis submitted*) supervised by [A/Prof. Nicholas Geard](https://sites.google.com/site/nicgeard), [Prof. Karin Verspoor](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dUxHnbcAAAAJ), [Prof. Justin Zobel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uEHvqE8AAAAJ&hl=en), and [Benjamin Goudey](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=OiHpCBoAAAAJ&hl=en), at the School of Computing and Information Systems, the University of Melbourne. I excel in applying computational techniques, including natural language processing, machine learning, and bioinformatics to solve real-world challenges. I've led projects automating quality assurance for gene ontology annotation and extracting semantic relations from electronic health records. Feel free to reach out if you're in need of a researcher to join your team with my expertise. <span style="color:red;">#OpenToOpportunities</span>
