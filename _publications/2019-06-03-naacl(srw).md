excerpt: 'This paper focuses on a traditional relation ex- traction task in the context of limited annotated data and a narrow knowledge domain. We ex- plore this task with a clinical corpus consisting of 200 breast cancer follow-up treatment let- ters in which 16 distinct types of relations are annotated. We experiment with an approach to extracting typed relations called window- bounded co-occurrence (WBC), which uses an adjustable context window around entity men- tions of a relevant type, and compare its per- formance with a more typical intra-sentential co-occurrence baseline. We further introduce a new bag-of-concepts (BoC) approach to fea- ture engineering based on the state-of-the-art word embeddings and word synonyms. We demonstrate the competitiveness of BoC by comparing with methods of higher complex- ity, and explore its effectiveness on this small dataset.'
