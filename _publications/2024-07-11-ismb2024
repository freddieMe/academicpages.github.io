excerpt: 'Motivation: Biological background knowledge plays an important role in the manual quality assurance (QA) of biological database records. One such QA task is the detection of inconsistencies in literature-based Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA). This manual verification ensures the accuracy of the GO annotations based on a comprehensive review of the literature used as evidence, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and annotated genes in GOA records. While automatic approaches for the detection of semantic inconsistencies in GOA have been developed, they operate within predetermined contexts, lacking the ability to leverage broader evidence, especially relevant domain-specific background knowledge. This paper investigates various types of background knowledge that could improve the detection of prevalent inconsistencies in GOA. In addition, the paper proposes several approaches to integrate background knowledge into the automatic GOA inconsistency detection process.
Results: We have extended a previously developed GOA inconsistency dataset with several kinds of GOA-related background knowledge, including GeneRIF statements, biological concepts mentioned within evidence texts, GO hierarchy and existing GO annotations of the specific gene. We have proposed several effective approaches to integrate background knowledge as part of the automatic GOA inconsistency detection process. The proposed approaches can improve automatic detection of self-consistency and several of the most prevalent types of inconsistencies.
This is the first study to explore the advantages of utilizing background knowledge and to propose a practical approach to incorporate knowledge in automatic GOA inconsistency detection. We establish a new benchmark for performance on this task. Our methods may be applicable to various tasks that involve incorporating biological background knowledge.'
